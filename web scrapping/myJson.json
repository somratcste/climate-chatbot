In our case, this mean:molefractionofCO2=measuredCO2totalmoleinthesamplesolutionmThis is well expressed and explained here in the section titled: Parts per Million by Volume (or mole) in AirIn air pollution literature ppm applied to a gas, always means parts per million by volume or by mole. These are identical for an ideal gas, and practically identical for most gases of air pollution interest at 1 atm. Another way of expressing this value is ppmv. One part per million (by volume) is equal to a volume of a given gas mixed in a million volumes of air:1ppm=1gasvolume1millionairvolume1at 1 atmosphere pressure.Thus a simple conversion can be applied and the equation solved, knowing the weight of a mole ofCO2Cand the typical weight of air. To answer your question, mole and volume are interchangeable in this context.This would be my honest take, considering the limited available information.",

Geothermal heat does not measurably affect the Icelandic climate unless you make your measurements very close indeed to geothermal activity. A lot depends on whereabouts you are in Iceland. The interior is mountainous and therefore colder, while the northern coast is nearer the Arctic Circle. It has been decided that Reykjavik, on the south-west coast, is the best place to make climate measurements rather than on a mountain glacier or on top of a geothermal heat source. Major volcanic eruptions are few and far between.",

                "text": "Since micro climates of a location are mostly based on temperature and precipitation patterns, I would suggest that yes, if focusing on precipitation alone, one would expect rising heat from geothermal activity off the surface as a variable to affect the formation and release of precipitation. But one would have to check what part of the island geothermal activity was highest as the jetstream would drag weather west to east if nearby, and given that it is a small island, may not record such an occurrence as a significant effect from the rising heat available around Iceland. I did find this article which is somewhat supportable of a heat increase around Iceland due to geothermal activity > Douglass/Patel and Knox, 2005.

                "text": "You have already hit on the reason Iceland has such a mild climate: the Gulf Stream. Geothermal heat does not measurably affect the Icelandic climate unless you make your measurements very close indeed to geothermal activity. A lot depends on whereabouts you are in Iceland. The interior is mountainous and therefore colder, while the northern coast is nearer the Arctic Circle. It has been decided that Reykjavik, on the south-west coast, is the best place to make climate measurements rather than on a mountain glacier or on top of a geothermal heat source. Major volcanic eruptions are few and far between.",
