        "question": "Are 60C heat waves predicted by 5C of global heating? (The worst consequence of global heating)",

        "text": "Are 60C heat waves predicted by 5C of global heating?(The worst consequence of global heating in heat waves that kill everything in their path)It seems to be the case that 1C of global heating caused the whole global temperature bell curve to shift two standard deviations to the right. (see below)To anyone knowing much about statistics and bell curves this would seem to make the 80 years BAU 5C temperature anomaly have the drastically lethal consequence of much more frequent heat waves greatly exceeding the 44C maximum human survival limit.My own projections of the current trend are a little more pessimistic than IPCC RCP8.5 projections. They simply extrapolate the current exponential increase of atmospheric CO2 and project 877 PPM by 2100 then apply the current IPCC equilibrium CO2 sensitivity formula3C \u00b1 1.5C for every doubling of atomospheric CO2log2(877/280) * 1.5 = 2.47log2(877/280) * 3.0 = 4.94 // Business as usual for 80 more yearslog2(877/280) * 4.5 = 7.41https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_17/When we examine this graph we see that a single degree of temperature anomaly is associated with a shift of the whole temperature bell curve two standard deviations to the right.If we hypothesize that a single degree of temperature anomaly directly caused the entire bell curve to shift the right two standard deviations then the consequences of a 5C would seem to be quite lethal.Once we numerically quantify the relationship between temperature anomaly and shifts of the bell curve then we would be able to apply this to historical geographical temperature extremes and predict the frequency, geographic and temporal extent of heat waves that would kill everything within their boundaries.This relationship seems to predict that the 5C temperature anomaly projected from \"business as usual\" for 80 more years could reasonably result in 60C (140F) killer heat waves. A 60C heat wave will kill everything in its path very quickly. Apparently humans cannot survive 44C for very long.",

For instance, increased cloud cover from the heat would increase cloud cover and rainfall as an 'air conditioning' event much like what is experienced in tropical regions. Also, if less cloud cover is not happening, then in the evening, much of this heat would escape to space and temperatures would drop below 60F in the evening as they do in the desert. Having living in both types of climates, daytime heat often balances by what happens in the evening."

In our case, this mean:molefractionofCO2=measuredCO2totalmoleinthesamplesolutionmThis is well expressed and explained here in the section titled: Parts per Million by Volume (or mole) in AirIn air pollution literature ppm applied to a gas, always means parts per million by volume or by mole. These are identical for an ideal gas, and practically identical for most gases of air pollution interest at 1 atm. Another way of expressing this value is ppmv. One part per million (by volume) is equal to a volume of a given gas mixed in a million volumes of air:1ppm=1gasvolume1millionairvolume1at 1 atmosphere pressure.Thus a simple conversion can be applied and the equation solved, knowing the weight of a mole ofCO2Cand the typical weight of air. To answer your question, mole and volume are interchangeable in this context.This would be my honest take, considering the limited available information.",
